To run SATbot, first download the two models at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cycrYd0S3Go7j3W2A50bJKQBn-oCdgZs/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HGmTFL-P4cXIInszLM3QjnuCVLj6zz7C/view?usp=sharing and place them in the 'model' subfolder.

Then run the backend and the frontend in two separate terminals following the instructions in the README files of the 'model' and 'view' subfolders respectively.


An expanded version of the EmpatheticPersonas dataset is contained in the model subfolder as `EmpatheticPersonas.csv`. Please see [An Empathetic AI Coach for Self-Attachment Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08316) for the associated publication.
